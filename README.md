# PhD Thesis Layout

The thesis layout included in this repository is designed for use within the Netherlands. However, the necessary pages (e.g. title page) are easily adapted into whatever your university requires.

The template includes custom fonts, trim lines, abstract environment design, chapter page and part page design with background images, and a thumbindex. An example of the generated template can be found [here](https://github.com/Flythe/Precious-Thesis-Template/blob/master/example.pdf). Note that for copyright reasons the original designs of the background images have been replaced with simple red boxes.

## History
This template is based on "Maggi Memoir Thesis" that is originally published on [Github](https://github.com/phretor/cs-phd-dissertation-latex-template) and later with some modifications on [LatexTemplates](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/maggi-memoir-thesis). S. Shahand has modified it further to typeset [his PhD thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/11245/1.490613) published at the University of Amsterdam. The final tweaks, fixes and documentation were done by me. Feel free to fork and modify it!
